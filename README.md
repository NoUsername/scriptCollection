# Script Collection #

A collection of:

* simple bash scripts
* config files (e.g. for bash and tmux)
* python scripts
* Windows batch scripts

which i have found useful (had thee need of and therefore wrote them at some point)

Also included is an install script that installes/copies the scripts to your system (for Linux).

Just checkout the project and run:

    bash install.sh
